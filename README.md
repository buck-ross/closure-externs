## Getting Started
First, install *Haximilian Closure Externs* into your project. The recommended way of doing this is using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) with the `-D` or `--save-dev` option to save *haximilian-closure-externs* as a development dependency in your `package.json` file:

> npm i -D haximilian-closure-externs

From there, feel free to use any of the following externs files, all of which can be found under the "/externs" directory:

 - `amd.js`: A file providing a very basic definition of the global objects present in the [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) specification.
 - `thenable.js`: A super-simple definition of the JavaScript "thenable" API as implemented by the [`Promise` standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)
