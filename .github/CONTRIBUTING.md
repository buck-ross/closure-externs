# Welcome
Hello! I'm [Haximilian](https://github.com/haximilian), the creator of the *Haximilian Closure Externs* project. I'm very happy to have
you on board with *Haximilian Closure Externs*, but before you run off and make awesome changes to our source code, please take the time
to read through this short file documenting our contributing policies, and also read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
You will be expected to follow our policies at all times when contributing to our project, and failure to do so will be taken very
seriously.

## Our policies
So long as you follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (Please do actually read it), the only other thing we ask of you
is that you please follow the provided templates for creating [Bug Reports](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md),
[Feature Requests](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), and [Pull Requests](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Actually Contributing
We follow the GitHub Standard [Fork and Pull Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_and_pull_model). If you have a change you
would like to make to the project, feel free to click that little "Fork" button at the top of the page on GitHub, make whatever
changes you so desire to your new personal copy of the project, and then let us know that you've done something awesome by
submitting a Pull Request to our project, using the [Official Pull Request Template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). If we like what
we see, then we'll merge your changes into the main project, and if not, then we'll tell you what you can change to make us more
likely to let you merge.

# Thank you
Your contributions as a member of our community mean a great deal to us. Without people like you, projects like this would never
get off the ground. Now get out there and do something amazing!

Sincerely,
Haximilian
